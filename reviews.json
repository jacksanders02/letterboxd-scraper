            "I kept waiting for something drastic. I thought the film was building towards something explosive. I thought the father might walk out and never come back. I thought he might die and that's why the need to recollect, the need to see in between the lines, to see what wasn't explicitly expressed. I thought we'd get an answer, but we don't. We know he's gone, but why or how is never explained. The two go back home from the vacation and there's a nice intercut shot of the daughter in the present pointing a camera at the film's camera and the father in the past doing the same until he puts his camera in a bag and walks out of the door. For a second I thought \"that's where it ends?\" because I felt like it wasn't enough, but it was.",
            "I took a moment to process my confusion and then I mentally rewound the film and realized that the journey wasn't about culminating with the dramatic event, the event had already happened. The story was instead completely about the need to understand. The meaning of the film was in all the small moments, but I was too busy expecting something big to appreciate the incredibly slight nature of the film.",
            "The meaning is where film's usually don't bother seeking meaning. Wanting to look inside a father through a child's eyes in order to attempt to understand what makes him tick isn't usually a significant enough of a story to be worth exploring, but it is. I'm in tears typing this because the film truly got under my skin in the careful and sensitive way it explores the relationship between the father and the daughter. The care and love present in the film is overwhelming.",
            "The story sees the father as someone who loves his daughter deeply, but he's struggling. He became a father too early and he doesn't feel like he can offer things he believes she should have and yet he doesn't even realize that it's all pressure he's unnecessarily putting on himself. In fact it's the pressure he's putting on himself which makes her frustrated. She remarks to him when he asks her if she wants singing lessons that she knows he doesn't have the money.",
            "It's a quietly crushing moment because we know how he feels hearing that, but she didn't mean anything bad by it. She's just expressing frustration over what she knows is an empty promise from experience. She doesn't understand how brutal of a comment it is because she doesn't know that he's beating himself up for not being able to give her more because how could she, she's just a kid. He wants to give her the world and the tragedy of it all of course is that she doesn't want the world, she just wants a dad and he can't see that's all he needs to be because of his likely depression.",
            "It's a moment the adult her now reflects on because she's now realizing what it spoke to when it comes to his underneath. She didn't understand what happened then, but she does understand it now. The memory is one of the more powerful moments in the film and it's all because of how slight it is. How it puts his internal turmoil on the center stage, without calling too much attention to it. It feels big in its smallness and the film is filled with moments like it.",
            "The restraint all around is the films biggest strength as the small moments never feel like you have to stop and process them. They happen and they settle in and because the film is devoid of massive dramatic beats and since the film is heavy on the happiness the two experienced together, it allows the melancholic undercurrent to shine through in more of a stark manner. It's the type of effort, which will pierce through whatever emotional shield you have up and leave you feeling vulnerable to the immense effect the film holds.",

            "we all knew barbie was going to be funny. we all knew it’d have something to say about the “female coming-of-age,” as all of greta gerwig’s movies have thus far. and we all knew margot robbie and ryan gosling would turn in note-perfect performances as barbie and ken. and they did.",
            "what i didn’t know was how much barbie would mean - not truly, not fully. how much it would mean to me, to the women sitting to my left and right, to all of us. the depth and breadth of its central message was something i couldn’t have ever anticipated, despite having the utmost faith in greta gerwig at every twist and turn. and even though i’d been looking forward to this film for years (five, in fact), it hit me right when i needed it most.",
            "",
            "a movie about growing up and realizing womanhood isn’t all pink, pleasure, and possibility. realizing that much of the world will hate you - always - no matter what you do, simply because of who you are. realizing that there comes a point when you either have to accept complacency within the patriarchy, or ostracization and vilification outside of it.",
            "or, maybe there’s another way. maybe womanhood isn’t all the fun and freedom we dreamed up in our youth, but maybe we don’t have to abandon it entirely either. maybe, just maybe, once we accept and begrudgingly embrace the often brutal reality of our everyday existence - while still retaining our inner strength at the same time - we can better reconcile all these cultural complications and contradictions and find a way to move through the world cautiously, but authentically. reveling in our - and the world’s - flaws instead of willfully overlooking them in favor of the “fantasy.” at long last.",
            "i learned these lessons a little late, because i started living as a woman a little late. in fact, i still have some learning to do. and sometimes, that scares me. but movies like this - art like this - make that education just a little bit easier. so thank you, barbie. you’re everything. and so am i."

            "I don’t think I can remember a time where I didn’t hear it.",
            "The ringing.",
            "The noise nobody but me could seem to hear. I couldn’t stand it. I had no idea what it was at first, but it was loud, and it was getting louder. I told myself it would just go away, but even back then I don’t think I believed myself.",
            "When I was nine it got worse, I was having hearing problems, so I told my parents. They took me to a doctor and I was officially diagnosed with mild hearing loss in my left ear, specifically of low tones, but they said it would get worse. I didn’t think to tell them about the ringing.",
            "The next year I learned to play the drums.",
            "It’s kind of funny, isn’t it? The kid who’s going deaf picks the instrument known for causing people to go deaf. But it made me happy, I wore earplugs and kept going.",
            "I turn seventeen in 6 months, I haven’t stopped drumming since. I’ve played countless hours of drums each year and I love it, I love music. I love hearing music, I love making music, even if that music is hurting me. I keep drumming, I don’t stop, not for any reason.",
            "I drum to keep myself focused",
            "I drum to disengage",
            "I drum to make something beautiful",
            "I drum to be loud and ugly",
            "I drum to declare my love",
            "I drum to release my hate",
            "Drumming is my outlet.",
            "And no matter what it means for me, I can’t just let it go, not right now.",
            "I’m going deaf, but the only thing I can do to fix anything is the one thing I refuse to do. I’m sealing my fate and acting like it’s some sort of unrelated incident because I’m unwilling to let it all go, I feel like nobody understands what I mean.",
            "Until now.",
            "So last year I heard about Darius Marder’s Sound of Metal while I was scrolling through Letterboxd in my chemistry class. I read the description and I couldn’t take it. My eyes started watering and I clicked the “Add to Watchlist” button.",
            "As my ringing became more prominent, mostly due to me beginning to prefer the quiet moments in life to the loud crashes I was once in favor of. I thought about Sound of Metal more and more, constantly checking the release date and comparing it to the current. I was waiting and waiting for any sign that I would be getting it soon, eventually the trailer came out on September 24th. I watched it on repeat for an hour. I couldn’t stop crying.",
            "In late October I tweeted an open letter telling Darius Marder about who I was and why his film meant so much to me. The mere existence of this movie made me more comfortable with being open about myself.",
            "I am a drummer, and I‘m losing my hearing. That was the general feel of it, I hit post and kept refreshing to see if anyone who followed me saw it. Not many people really read it, but the ones who did were really kind to me and I was glad to be sharing my life a little bit.",
            "I was still counting down the days until I would be able to see it, I was excited beyond belief, but I knew it would be a month before it’d be released in a way for me to watch it.",
            "I love this film. It’s just everything I could’ve possibly imagined it to be and more. I barely even know what to say here, but let me try my best.",
            "The screenplay by Darius and Abraham Marder is perfect, I won’t be getting too deep into spoilers (as the film has not yet officially released at the time of me writing this review) but everything feels so real. There’s never anything feeling forced or out of place, and it never feels too slow or too fast. It very well might have the most perfect pacing out of any movie I’ve ever seen. Scenes never rush to the point or drag on past their rightful end, leaving time for the audience to feel the emotional beats without letting the emotions fade away. One scene in particular discussing addictions to sound is just so perfect that I can’t even describe how much I love it. Without glamorizing deafness, the Marders use the idea of a community based on learning to love your deafness to show a story about learning to love and accept who you are.",
            "Now onto the part everyone raves about: the editing. Sure, the visual editing is great, with shots flowing together seamlessly, but that’s not what I mean, I’m talking about sound editing. The sound design is absolutely incredible, with the highs and lows of the ringing hitting so close to my own that I couldn’t tell if it was me or the movie. The perfect contrast between the silence Ruben hears and the noises from everyone else makes Sound of Metal a disturbingly aggressive watch. The sounds of the cochlear implants are incredible, and rather than just dim the sounds and put fuzz over the dialogue, they choose to make the sounds overlap and rush together, while still playing with the tones and pitch of the noise around him. From research on cochlear implants, people who have them seem to cite the biggest problem to be adapting to hearing so many overlapping, indistinct sounds when in crowded settings, and this is shown beautifully. I applaud the sound designers, they’ve put in so much work and it’s paid off.",
            "As you’ve probably heard, the acting is exceptional, Riz Ahmed delivers one of the best performances I’ve seen in a long time. With sign language he’s able to evoke emotion most actors only dream of being able to with spoken words. His hands aren’t the only parts telling the story though, his voice is still just as packed with emotion as every movement, every line hits like another punch until you’re broken down in tears at the slightest breath he takes. I was really sold on Ahmed as an actor post-Nightcrawler, and I’m all in on him now. What a mind-blowing performance. Everyone else is awesome as well, with Olivia Cooke and Paul Raci in particular being faces I’d love to see more often.",
            "This movie is just so unbelievably good, with the final shot somehow being the most impactful moment in a film that feels as if it were designed to impact me. I love it so much, and it’s a perfect ending to what is now one of my favorite films.",
            "To everyone involved, thank you for telling this story of acceptance and love, I think you’ve truly crafted something beautiful here. You’ve made hearing loss seem less like a burden and more like just another way to live. Knowing about that community of love and hope brings me comfort. I’m Carter, I love movies, and I’m a drummer. My hearing isn’t great, and I know it’s only going to get worse.",

I cried in the first 30 minutes when Barbie meets an old woman and simply says, “you’re beautiful”. I cried laughing at the “can I play the guitar at you” Ken bit. But I think people are discounting how many clear limitations there are for this movie that is still a toy commercial, and apparently a car commercial, with an overzealous script that can give some tonal whiplash. So it’s not the feminist masterpiece that early reactions lead me to believe, but still a really fun and inventive exploration of some stuff many of us have frustrations about. Oscar noms incoming for those costumes/prod. design."

            "You never really shake that feeling of seeing darkness in your parents that you don’t understand yet. The sudden realization that holes are being poked in your perfect image of them, and you don’t know whether to resent them or pity them or all of the above. I don’t like to get very personal with reviews but it’s hard to separate my thoughts on Aftersun from my own experiences, and it’s worth mentioning that I’ve probably never felt so acutely understood and affected by a film in my life. I think this is being described as a complicated but somewhat universal relationship, and in many ways it is, but Charlotte Wells is also getting at something specifically dark and definitely triggering for some. She perfectly marries this sun soaked father/daughter vacation with a backdrop of constant unease, never really letting you relax because you know something more insidious is going on, expressing it all through the disorienting blend of adult realizations and hazy childhood memories. The subtle signs you couldn’t comprehend, that you shouldn’t have had to, and the moments that become tainted. Complicated feelings of anger, regret, and reminiscence. I’ve never seen it portrayed so accurately and poignantly. Paul Mescal deserves an Oscar for this. This is a really beautiful and gut wrenching film that I don’t want to and probably couldn’t watch again. But you should all go see it!👍🏼"

            "When I was 17 or 18 I was eating lunch at this place called New York Subs (now closed) and I ordered my sandwich and sat down in front of this man (who I later learned was my parents' dentist, incidentally) who was by himself waiting on his food. When the waitress came by to bring him his order, I heard her ask him about the crossword puzzle he was doing. \"Yeah, I find it's a lot easier to do the longer words first, then you can kind of work your way out from there. But sometimes I just can't solve the longer ones, and the shorter ones can help with those.\" There was something about this exchange that was inexplicably heartbreaking, so much so that it's stuck in my brain almost ten years later. Punch-Drunk Love conveys a lot of different things very well, but it's the only movie I've ever seen that captures how I felt listening to that guy talk about his crossword puzzle. I think he might be dead now."

A hard-hitting social drama chronicling years in the life of a man broken and haunted by his own failure to prevent the darkness and devastation that enveloped the world following the introduction of the atomic bomb and the inadvertent opening of a door to an endless plague of hopelessness and destruction set upon future generations; a film which truly encapsulates the sheer power, abject terror, and subsequent futility that humankind was forced to face in the wake of its own unimaginable creation; a story told through the eyes of determined engineers, scientists, and soldiers gathered in the name of national pride to nobly save their culture and civilization as they knew it from the raw, monstrous horrors to which they had borne witness; and an ambiguous resolution to the inevitable humanist clash between blind optimism and bleak reality.",

            "I am standing in a room and I am looking at my dad.",
            "It is 1996 and he is 33 years old and he is journaling hour by hour the day that I am born. He is the first person to ever put my name to paper. It is 2008 and he is 45 years old and he is gripping my arms too tight and screaming at me, so close I can smell the beer on his breath. I am telling him I do not want to live with him anymore because it makes me too anxious to see the way he drinks. It is 2012 and he is 49 years old and two states away from me, he is collapsing while on a walk, braindead before he hits the ground, from an injury acquired while drunk.",
            "I am standing in a room and I am looking at my dad and he is both the man people told me “loved being your dad more than anything” and someone I was, and maybe still am, deeply angry with. I am stuck, frozen, by the overwhelming, simultaneous urge to fling myself into his arms and step back if he tries to get close. He is the man who would always wrap me in a towel after I got out of a pool and would squeeze me tight until my teeth stopped chattering. He is the man who volunteered to be my soccer coach every year, 8 years in a row. He is the man who would sing the loudest at all my birthday parties. He is the man who would keep open Dr. Pepper cans in his car that were full of beer instead of pop. He is the man who would leave me drunken, raging voicemails after I stopped living with him. He is all these men, these fractured pieces of a half formed person. He is deteriorating before my very eyes with each passing year, preserved solely by my context-lacking, ever-fading memories and the remnants of video tapes from our old, family camcorder and photos.",
            "I am standing in a room and I am looking at myself at 16 years old, on the floor of my dad’s closet, his favorite sweatshirt pressed into my face. I am taking in the smell of him with each inhale, terrified I will forget what he smelled like. I did forget what he smelled like. I am screaming with every exhale, the fabric muffling the sound so that it is for my ears only, a brief moment to let myself truly become undone by the weight of his loss. I am 16 years old and my dad is dead and he died before we could be okay again.",
            "I am standing in a crowded room and I am looking at my dad as he dances. The music is too loud to hear my wailing. I am trying to grab hold of him so he can hear me. I need him to stop dancing so he can see what’s coming towards us and pull us out of the way of this great, barreling beast of devastation. But he can’t hear me because he’s not really there and I’m not really there either and the great, barreling beast has come and gone and left me ragged and fatherless and with the agonizing realization that my dad died not knowing me just as much as I don’t know him.",
            "This is Aftersun. Attempting reconciliation with a ghost. Untangling every memory to pinpoint the moments you understand with more painful clarity now that you are yourself an adult. Examining your grief like a science experiment, seeing the bruise it has left on you and pressing your thumb down into it, recording how sharp the sting still is. Gathering up the pieces of him you knew from your limited time with him and trying to piece them together, a jigsaw puzzle with half the pieces missing. Rewinding the tape again and again and again, standing an inch from the screen, staring at the grainy image of his face, at the upturn of his smile, trying to determine if it was genuine, if he was as happy with you as you desperately hope he was. Having to turn the movie off and accept you’ll never know for sure, exhaling in relief at the weight lifted by the bittersweet acceptance. Finding the ability to smile a little through the tears when you think of him, remembering that he loved you the best he could, no matter what, until the very end."

            "A few minutes after my screening of Lightyear started, a mom and a young girl — I’d guess she was maybe 10 or 11 years old — arrived at the theater, and sat down right next to me. At first I was annoyed because I’m a germaphobic weirdo and I like to keep a little space around me at the theater these days if at all possible. This mom and daughter didn’t even leave me a buffer seat. For a minute or two, I thought about moving to a less crowded part of the theater.",
            "I stayed because it quickly became clear that this girl was loving the film, and seeing it through her eyes was a special thing to behold. She was invested in this story in the way only a kid can be invested in a story. She bounced up and down in her seat, repeated the dialogue back to the screen in a soft voice, and cheered all the big heroic moments. During a crucial scene late in the film, she whispered “Don’t do it Buzz!” with such intensity I was terrified Buzz would do it and break this poor kid’s heart forever.",

            "Beginning to think the MCU is a money laundering front because WHERE is the budget going?? This is one of the worst looking films I have ever seen, even by Marvel standards. Incompetent across the board, and at 30 films in it’s inexcusable for the biggest franchise in the world to be churning out films this bad. They don’t need to be highbrow dramas or anything but they at least need to feel tactile and not just serve as a trailer for the next instalment. GOTG3 is looking to be the last breath of life this franchise has left.",

            "There's a moment about halfway through Before Sunset that I can't get out of my mind. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) are sitting in a Parisian café, and she lights up a cigarette. He's got the demeanor of a man who has quit smoking against his will (probably at the behest of a significant other, whom I'm guessing broke his spirit with the subtlest \"I just want you to be healthy\" psychological warfare imaginable), so he steals a quick glance at the carcinogenic happiness hanging from Delpy's lips. And then... there's this look that comes across his face. Richard Linklater doesn't draw any attention to it, and it's so brief that you might miss it. But it's a look that says \"I remember what it was like to be twenty-three, chain-smoking until dawn and caught up in conversation with the girl across from me.\" (Can I have a drag of that?) It's the look of a man who was once in love with this girl, and was in love with himself for being in love with this girl. (Actually, do you have another one of those?) It's the look of someone who's relieved that there's at least one thing that hasn't changed over the past nine years, this one slender thread that connects the events of the present to the memories of one night in a happier time. (Can I get a light?) It's a perfect moment.",
            "It's perfect because it's honest. Hawke looks exactly as he should look, and behaves exactly as he should behave. And that's the beauty of Before Sunset, perhaps even more than its equally-impressive predecessor. Age has stripped some of the idealistic veneer off of Jesse and Celine, and this allows the film to tap into moments of truth that weren't necessarily possible in Before Sunrise. I mean, this movie is still as much of a faerie tale as the earlier film, made for people who dream about finding their soulmates and engaging in rambling conversations far more witty and erudite than anything they could ever come up with themselves. But Linklater instinctively knows how to ground his characters in moments that resonate on a purely realistic level, and suddenly the faerie tale seems plausible. I love The Princess Bride and Singin' in the Rain and the films of Preson Sturges because they allow me to engage with a beautiful fantasy. I love Before Sunset because it allows me to believe in the fantasy.",
            "And I know that I've been talking about perfect moments and perfect honesty and whatnot, but here's the beautiful paradox of the Before Sunset fantasy: I can believe in it because it isn't perfect. This isn't the story of two beautiful, intelligent, fascinating people whose love has traversed the ages unspoiled. It's about two (beautiful, intelligent, fascinating) people thrown together after a decade of unhappiness, insecurity, and disappointment. There's no guarantee for a blissful future as our heroes free themselves from the shackles of their unhappy memories, either. Jesse and Celine (and just about all of the rest of us) aren't wired that way. They can't quarantine the past, or temporarily set it aside to exist in the moment (which their younger selves had little problem doing). For all their desire to pick up right where they left off, their conversations inevitably drift towards the messiness of their past and present selves. Whereas their younger incarnations talked about art and literature and beauty, they now speak of toddlers and careers and the threat of global warming. But there's that spark that gets kindled, a spark that suggests that maybe, maybe, there are still possibilities that exist outside of what they've grown accustomed to expect from their lives. And isn't that a more beautiful, humble, life-affirming sentiment than \"they lived happily ever after?\"",
            "And I'm not even really scratching the surface of what makes this film so special. There's wit and wisdom in the dialogue, of course, and the film gives us two leads with such natural chemistry that it feels scientifically engineered or something. But my affection for this film goes deeper than that, to a place that I can't exactly explain. How do I describe the joy I get in seeing Jesse bum a smoke or hearing him extemporaneously quote Thomas Wolfe? Or how about the delight I get from seeing Celine dance to Nina Simone or tell a dirty joke about a Buddhist monk? These aren't moments that have any grand importance. They don't convey any deeper meaning about life or love or anything else. Still, they're moments that thrill me and comfort me for reasons beyond my understanding. Maybe it simply comes down to this: I love Before Sunset because it allows me to briefly inhabit a world where people like Jesse and Celine exist."

            "The best aspect of this courtroom drama is how patiently it reveals its intention to show how a microscopic lens on a relationship can be uglier and more hurtful than existing in the relationship itself. That level of scrutiny over an argument or the cloud of doubt over an unknowable intent. Sandra Hüller is great but I was immensely impressed by the arc and performance of her young son, Milo Machado Graner, who is having to navigate an adult methodology of poking and prodding for truth and one answer is that his mother is a murderer and the other is that his father, whom he was closest to, committed suicide.",
            "Justine Triet's film has all the trappings of a whodunnit but it's mostly about how people change. And how we look for evidence on why they changed—even though it never adds up to a single moment like a crime of passion has the capacity to do. For Hüller, and her now deceased husband, it's the change that comes from love turning to resentment for feeling trapped by another person's choices. For Graner it's the change of seeing his parents as deeply flawed humans who shielded him from so much pain they experienced together. It's not a dissection of a fatal fall from a window. It's everyone falling from grace very publicly and especially in the (already clouded from an accident) eyes of a child. It's not a stirring film but it resonates and ripples with truth. Including how it leaves the audience wondering past the ending if mother or son were fabricating things to control a narrative that is so much more expansive — from first love to fall — and cannot be solved without evidence. Much like the feelings of love itself. There is no evidence. Even actions can have unknown and selfish ulterior motives.",
            "Some very interesting directorial choices from Triet, too, like using a flashback for half a scene but then letting an audio recording exist like it would for a juror for the points without talking. She constantly chooses to listen rather than show or tell. It perhaps doesn't come what you want it to be—much like the disappointed reporters on the steps of the courthouse—because it resists that urge. It is a marriage. With photographs of happier times. Headlines for the worst of time. But only the mind can hold how things happened, both the good and the bad. Holding love that's insufficient in regards to evidence. But it's there. Despite all of the worst things that can be submitted.",
            "And it also taught me something new about salt and water mixed together for a very specific use."

            "It begins with the mountain and ends with the sea. The two contrasting images always accompany the film. Like Seo Rae's dress, some people think it's green; others see blue. The wallpaper in her home shows patterns of mountain peaks, but upon closer look, they look like thousands of waves crashing into each other. The mountain and the sea seem so close, yet are always out of each other’s reach. If the wise love the water and the benevolence the mountains, the lovelorn will always choose to stay behind in the earth. No one ever wanted to leave but always having to pass by.",

            "felt so prepared to fall in love with this film but i couldn't help feeling like everything was a little underdeveloped. in the film we spend time with essentially three characters for 106 minutes, and somehow they all feel sort of surface-level in exploration. it just feels like a lot of this film is people discussing what other people are like without really seeing that exemplified in the film itself. greta lee is excellent, but i just feel like she doesn't have a lot to do besides agree with or reject what other people are projecting onto her, and in the end she feels a little distant to me perhaps because we really only see who she is with these two men and never just as a person living her life. as an exploration of the way time feels, it's really successful, but for me personally i think that it's a little too heady and abstract to really hit me on an emotional level. there are a few scenes here and there that are so compelling (the frustrating nature of skype, the scene where nora is explaining to arthur whether she's attracted to hae sung or not) and i think i just wanted the whole thing to feel a little more grounded than it is, which is just taste and probably not what celine song was interested in. so ignore me if you don't feel similarly. beautifully shot though <3 and shoutout to naming your main character nora :)"

This is about trauma, family, memory, disaster, and the depopulation of the Japanese countryside.

When the other dancer transforms into Nina and she stabs herself, it’s her killing the white swan aka the innocence that prevented her from fully becoming the black swan. That’s why her injury doesn’t reappear until she’s the white swan for the final act. I think it wasn’t a physical wound but a metaphorical wound. She killed the innocence, and at the creciendo of swan lake where the white swan commits suicide, the blood blooms and she starts profusely bleeding out. Therefore, it’s the death of the white swan also known as what held her back from becoming the black swan, or what was left of it.",

            "Assuredly, almost off-handedly disregards the Elvis mythos in favor of an isolated character piece of desire and objectification. A teenage Priscilla is groomed, prepped, and delicately placed in the narrative of Presley's celebrity. A crucial moment observes our protagonist as she sits on all of the Graceland furniture, adjusting her stance and posture, rehearsing for a future encounter with Elvis. There is no room for individuality - Priscilla is a prisoner in a house that Elvis barely lives in. Coppola's eye for alluring surface pleasures has never been more of a betrayal. As spectators, we feel seduced, ignored, tossed aside, with all those wasted years felt through montage. Slivers of painful memories. Coppola marks the mid-point of the film with Priscilla's *high-school* graduation, as if it isn't clear enough. Two sequences (Vegas and the Roller Rink) gave me a  rush, but the emptiness and despair is never far behind. Brilliant work all-around."

She’s weak, but is stronger than anyone she’s around. She’s kind, but could break every bone in every body with her words. And yet, she’s in love.",
            "She does something I’ve never been able to do. She does what I’ve always dreamed of doing and have constantly beat myself up for not being able to. Alma is cruel without warning. She can stand up for herself without fear, because she knows what she wants. And yet at the same time, she can be gentle and kind. She craves attention, which in most films is seen as annoying or unjustified, but she completely owns it. I long for attention but don’t know how to get it without sounding like a blubbering idiot, and I only want it from people who don’t like showing it. But whenever I watch Phantom Thread, over and over again, I find strength in Alma.",
            "Whenever I feel unimportant, or alone, or less than what I am, I try to imagine I’m Alma. I find comfort in her. Her ability to go through Reynolds, and her ability to discover herself through other people. She gets what she wants and how she wants it, and I understand every fiber of who she is. She’s truly the love of my life, and I can’t wait to discover her even more."

And in Mr. Park's case, giving a sarcastic answer that undercuts his saying 'yes'. Min and Mr. Park are both seen as powerful figures deserving of respect, and the way they dismissively respond to an earnest question about whether they truly care for the people they're supposed to tells us a lot about how powerful people think about not just the people below them, but everyone in their lives.",

            "Probably MacDonagh’s opus to me. Fascinating to see someone whose work I have generally thought of as bitter, cynical, and spiteful (in a clever and entertaining way) confront the way that bitterness, cynicism, and spite isolate and destroy people by deadening the things that kept their kindness afloat. And it’s so funny!! Everyone involved is at the top of their game but I’m particularly impressed by Colin Farrell. I don’t know how or why he looks so different here than he usually does but it accentuates his dopiness and sadness in a way that really makes you pity him, until you’re no longer fully meant to (at which point you sort of see the Farrell we’ve seen for years.)"

            "I’m glad The Menu never takes itself too seriously, because the movie is at it’s best when it gets extremely goofy, which is often. The story may veer into the predictable side of things, but like the film’s ornate food presented to its posh patrons, it’s all about the *journey*. It’s always a treat to see the elite get humiliated, but high brow foodie culture needs to get dunked on more often and The Menu is maybe the best (or at least my favorite) to do it."

A Chinese crime drama plays in the background, noise fading away in nothingness. I am in her arms, closer than I've ever been. She smells like lavender, I note. This is an Asian family, and we don't touch much. But whenever we do, it matters. I'm crying about something I don't have the heart to tell her about. She draws me closer, telling me that no one in the world loves you more than family. When all is come and gone, family is all that remains and all that you can trust. What could matter more?",

Trying to escape, but how can you escape a room when the sky is crashing down?",

I spend time locked away in my room, wondering what it would be like if I just walked out and let them know. I have never had anxiety so bad that I couldn't sleep, wondering if the world would be a better place without me.

To live in a world of memories where I can guitar my ghosts and rewrite them into a better, less cruel world. I'm terrified of being alone. There is never enough time, and I don't know when to hit cut. Yet the film ends with such light. Adam, though alone, is radiant, propelled forward by people's love for him, by the love that he now knows he can provide. He reconciles with his past, and I reconcile with my future.       ",

This essentially feels like a kind of dark fairytale. Priscilla’s brought into Elvis Presley’s in the way of the dreams of many young girls around the world. There are times she enjoys it but it drains her. It takes years away from her.",

Priscilla doesn’t speak much but Cailee’s performance shows nearly every emotion. The lack narration from the book was interesting but the silence fills rooms here. It’s like she wandered into a haunted house with her parent’s approval and couldn’t get out when she was done having fun.",
            "The movie looks gorgeous and the soundtrack is phenomenal. The choice by Elvis’ estate to not let his music in the movie worked positively for it. Without that music he loses some of the mystique he has. He’s just a normal abusive man. Sofia Coppola’s back! This was beautiful."

            "The film starts with high concepts and the “adventure” ends with 30 minutes left. Joe Gardner is both gifted and soo normal. Basically, Pixar started with a concept as broad as purpose and stretched it using as many shapes, colors, textures, and sounds as they could and as a result they made one of the most clever animated films I’ve personally seen.  Very crazy to think a young generation is going to grow up and go “can’t believe we all watched SOUL when we were little...and on Christmas?!?”",
            "I also should note that I’m a part of that “Inside Out is so overrated” group. Because rather than feeling like something cleverly weaving together story, character, and concept, that felt so heavily like “THIS is the concept.” Whereas this clearly started with a character who had a story that was begging to be told and thoughts Pete Doctor NEEDED to put to film, not just an idea they thought would make people cry. It had, dare I say, a soul to it??",

            "this is the first movie i’ve shown my dad in a long time that he didn’t fall asleep to, which is such an achievement that i might make it my movie of the year. gets better every rewatch, don’t honestly know what is holding it back at all which is why i had to bump it all the way up. i notice a new detail every viewing; i only just this time saw that when colm is standing on the beach in the first hour, he’s standing on the foot tracks of the man who walked into the water the night before, which is a crazy image. the score didn’t really do much for me my first time but i’ve grown to really love the ways it uses such tiny sounds to drive a story, really fits (and adds to) the tone. and this might be the first time ever that a movie has looked better on the tv at home than it did in the theater. i used to think the cinematography in this was nothing to write home about but my GOD those colors pop. maybe that’s less the movie and more the tv. either way! i just love how simple and unpretentious and sad and TRUE this movie is, you wouldn’t think something this simple would be so rewatchable but i can’t wait to watch it again. love love love this movie!!"

I noticed it and was like “oh wow I should not be smiling this hard I look weird” and 5 seconds later went back to smiling. The love and care that is oozing out of this film gives it this dreamlike feeling that I haven’t felt since, well, Lady Bird. Overwhelmed really is the best word to describe my initial reaction when it ended because this thing gives you so much to love and hold on to. It makes me so glad that this thing exists and is a film I can eventually own on blu-ray and just watch whenever I need to! I haven’t even read the book! Which brings me to my point that I was honestly a little confused sometimes (I blame the editor) and it honestly is probably the main reason I didn’t cry when I was totally supposed to. But again....this film does so much good. I love you Greta Gerwig!!!!"

What I find fascinating is why so many audiences have accepted the film’s warm embrace— it’s a tangible reminder that we, as living human beings, all crave and deserve love.",

            "while iain reid's novel extracts horror from blood and dread, charlie kaufman's interpretation extracts it from existentialism, from the unavoidability of aging, from the unease of being perceived, from the eeriness permeating the claustrophobic atmosphere. they both tell the same story in completely different ways, which is exactly what a book-to-film adaptation should aim to do.",
            "in the book, there's a fascinating passage about how humans need allegory and metaphor in order to more comprehensively understand the world around us. this is the most central idea of the film, i think: our tendency to tell ourselves stories in order to live (a personal fav sub-genre of mine, thank you joan didion). especially as it seems to function as an unexpected reckoning of film history, with lengthy homages to golden-age musicals and parodies of contemporary cheesy studio dramas -- a character even directly quotes pauline kael's controversial review of A Woman Under the Influence during a conversation about cassavetes (🥰).",
            "here, kaufman once again proves he's a master of the subconscious and all of its abstract intricacies. \"you can't fake a thought.\" our thoughts silently exhibit us at our most authentic, most private, most vulnerable. the only other people who have access to our psyches are generally our partners, and even they can't see it all. we can choose to find either terror or comfort in that. or, we can sequester ourselves by idealizing strangers so we don't have to form real connections and risk heartbreak! but i suppose that's just choosing terror."

            "To give a hint at what's special about TÁR you needn't look further than the opening credits. The opening credits start backwards with members of the crew that generally are at the very end of the end credits, like catering and production units and assistant editors. This is a movie about how an ego can grow too big and turn to manipulation when one role gets too much credit in a collaborative field. An orchestra is like a film set, and most collaborators get shoved to the back of a program or the end of the film credits. While this adds to the movie's run time up front, it's a fitting gesture for the movie you're about to watch.",
            "Discussions of what’s the perfect run time for a movie are perhaps the most boring of all film talk. Whether it’s 72 minutes or 210 minutes, the true test of a runtime is what purpose it had in the length; whether it’s lean or long, what did the filmmaker set to do within those confines? And did it work? That’s all that matters. 158 minutes will be a big talking point around TÁR. It’s a movie star character piece with very little plot, something rare these days, but even when these types of movies were more common, they didn’t run that long.",
            "",
            "TÁR follows a revered classical composer/conductor, Lydia Tár (Cate Blanchett), in the weeks leading up to a career moment of completing the fifth of the five Mahler adaptations. She is the first woman to be the lead conductor of The Berlin Philharmonic. She is a member of the EGOT club. She is a mother. Her partner (Nina Hoss) has a chair in her orchestra. Do we need to listen to almost the entirety of a sit-down interview with The New Yorker? What about her caretaker neighbor next door who’s always looking for her mother’s newspaper? What about multiple running scenes? Yes. This is a movie about how someone extremely respected composes herself. She always has an audience, whether it's journalists, an adoring old guard of conductors, a roomful of young students, and even a young girl who’s picking on her daughter at school.",
            "Writer/director Todd Field drops small hints throughout that there are some secrets that her assistant (Noémie Merlant) knows, but the exact information is withheld from us because Lydia won’t engage with discussing certain people. This isn’t done as a trick against the audience but rather with an organic touch of how two people who have known each other for a long time would speak to each other, particularly when it’s desired to dismiss a potential discussion from starting. Parallel to this, we watch her navigate how to use her power to usher some old white men into retirement, dangle possible promotions to young women, and stroke the egos of the old white men of whom she needs the support. Tár rose to prominence in a field dominated for centuries by white men, but—despite starting a successful program to place women conductors—she defends the greatness of many men that the younger generation has taken issue with. She will answer questions about gender, but doesn’t define her place in history within that narrative.",
            "What Field and Blanchett are building toward is a character portrait that shows us a complicated woman who orchestrates her own fall from grace. It engages with multiple topical talking points without ever using the buzzwords and dog whistle terms that would hand over the narrative to the audience with their preconceived notions already firm. So I won’t use the terms in this review either because Field and Blanchett thrillingly reveal their intent like peeling an onion. The runtime is warranted because anything shorter would lose the nuance of power dynamics—including when people decide to turn.",
            "Whether someone is corrupted, flawed, or uses the wrong language, it’s rare that someone is evil through and through. A fall from grace story is a tale as old as time. But in an era where many audiences are looking for signals from the filmmaker to whether a certain behavior is condoned, Field instead has chosen to present a character fully, not to make a statement, but solely to make a portrait in unexpected ways. When Lydia hears a woman screaming in the park, she tries her best to locate her via the direction of her voice, but she cannot. When a character’s flat is empty, that empty space is there to speak for the threat they knew would come. This is Field’s first film in 16 years and so people are primed to look for clues that will tell why this was the movie he came back with. But for me, the remarkable details in how information is revealed entirely through a central performance is the reason TÁR excites. Not what it has to say, but how it tells us the story through a dual execution of performance and writing preparation.",
            "Of course, TÁR sinks or swims depending on the performances and Blanchett commands every one of these 158 minutes. She is already a generational performer but TÁR has to be one of her all-time best performances. In more ways than one, this is her Raging Bull. It’s a metronome of a performance, swinging back and forth from public persona to private persona with only small changes between the two. But any shift is revealing, deeply human, and truthful; all of this to vacillate between Lydia’s positive and negative attributes. This is a master class of acting. And while Blanchett astounds, I’d be remiss to not also highlight Hoss, who gets to be the stand-in for the audience, in piecing together Lydia’s actions, but she does so with astounding grace and disbelief. Every woman in TÁR gets to swing on a character metronome, not just Blanchett. Each has a little pocket of allowance for Lydia’s space to dominate others. This is another layer of the run time that is used optimally.",
            "“Time is the thing. Time is the essential piece of interpretation. You cannot start without me; I start the clock.” That’s how Lydia Tár describes her profession. It’s also the best way to approach the movie. You give yourself over to the amount of time a filmmaker and performer use to present their story. Time is also an era, however, and this era requires more time to thoughtfully explore muddy waters. More time still, if the time is not being used to make an easy topical statement. And all the time you need if you have a performer like Blanchett playing the notes.",

That is the height of cinematic craftsmanship to me, and it has been absent from movies ever since. Nothing comes close."

            "I liked the film but it wasn’t perfect. Let’s start with the positives. Florence Pugh is stellar in this, it’s a career best turn from her. She was magnificent. Chris Pine as well killed it, he was brilliant. Harry Styles was good as well. The cinematography was STUNNING. Every shot deserved to be framed, honestly mesmerizing. The production design and costumes were really fantastic too. The problem with the film was that it was too heavy handed and predictable and the ending was a bit underwhelming. Also a few writing decisions were bad. The plot was very intriguing though! I liked the film, I recommend it. It’s worth watching for the cinematography and acting definitely. Messy but fun"

While some of the larger set pieces (the plane crash, the avalanches) are technically astounding, it's the raw humanity of the writing and performances that shine through the most. I'm frankly amazed I haven't heard more chatter about awards for this, as I think it's absolutely one of the best films from 2023, hands down.",

            "I think it's incredible how subtly Chazelle tells us everything we need to know about Jack after his best friend dies. The very first thing he says after learning about George dying is \"He was the first one to say I have talent.\" When he nervously and uncertainly watches the edit of his first-ever talkie scene, he says \"I wish George could’ve seen it.\" George is his best friend and Jack still doesn't really love him, he loves what he represents to Jack– confidence in his status. Jack's \"I love you\" scene doesn't work because he's a man who has never truly loved a person, only his own fame and power. The four marriages are a confirmation of this. His scene in the talkie was just a simulacrum of real emotion, but something he never felt. And for a while, that was his greatest strength.",
            "For all the Boogie Nights comparisons that people (me included) have made about this movie, Chazelle's work kind of positions him as the anti-PTA in one crucial way: PTA is a deep romantic and Chazelle is not. PTA makes movies about people that find connection in the strangest ways, and Chazelle makes movies about people needing to sacrifice connection in pursuit of greatness. I love them both a lot, but if you ask me which filmmaker's ethos would prime me the most to accept a shot of Avatar in a \"movies have the power to change the world\"-ass montage soundtracked by a frenetic mashup of the score I just heard at the end of their film, I would probably say \"Wait what? Why would that be in either. Or any movie\""

            "it just doesn’t click. a gorgeous facade, masking the vagueness of the dialogue and intentions and feelings of the characters. dripping with scenic appeal, but i’m only slightly charmed by it. what tries to be one of the most sincere movies in years only feels hollow to me, even when i try to let it in. oliver and elio are different ages, but it’s the maturity level that bothers me here: one, a man, going out by himself until dawn. the other, only a boy, sitting with his parents, being read a fairlytale while it rains outside. he puffs out his chest and acts older than his age. and that’s what it is: an act. he can be intelligent and wise and ready for love, but is he mature enough for a relationship like this. it’s that imbalance that has me trying to break down the walls of this thing and see it more clearly. the way they talk and interact rings empty to me, only getting glimpses of true tenderness, split seconds of actual romance. oliver comes off the emptiest of all, i counted on one hand the times i could see his true nature, and half of those, i didn’t like what i saw. maybe he loved elio, but i can’t quite see it. and what i’m left with is a chilly ending, reflected in flames by the best bit of acting the movie has to offer",
            "but, all that said, i’m aware of the fact that people love it so. love it, relate to it, are enchanted by it. and i’m trying to let that be what it is, because the above is only my opinion, and we all have such drastically different opinions. in the end, all we can do is scribble our thoughts down and move on. discussion is maybe the most important aspect of a movie like this, or a time like this: to be open to discuss a movie and it’s good sides and it’s bad sides, even if you hold it dear to your heart. or despise it",

            "It's the feeling of never wanting a dream to end, desperately trying to go back to sleep hoping that your dream would somehow pick up where it had left off.",
            "But you know very well that it won't. First you'll forget the details. What shirt you were wearing, the exact words you said or wanted to say. Her hand on your palm that felt so tangible just a few seconds ago, reduced to a cold sensation that served as nothing but a reminder of the warmth that was once there.",
            "Then the timeline becomes murky, sequences become knotted up -- like how mitsuha's grandmother had so wisely put it: Musubi  dayo. Time is a knot. The location comes before the journey there, cause and effect all collapse in an instant.",
            "You can't remember the weather, or the exact time of day. It felt golden, the sun may or may not be present, was her eyes sparkling because of the comet? Why yes, there was a comet slowly crawling up above, leaving a trail of sparkling dust behind like something out of a desktop wallpaper. The comet traveled all across the galaxy to arrive on earth, like how you had traveled all across the country to meet----",
            "To meet who, again? Ah, all is lost now, absolutely irrevocable. What's left is a lingering sadness which reason you had forgotten. A need to remember someone dear, a stroke of marker pen on your palm and a simple wish for company. How cruel it is for our dream to force itself away from us, beyond our control."

            "there's something poisonous about being forcibly stuck inside as a person who views creative work as their life's goal; when there's nothing to do but create, your mind starts to eat itself and make you feel bad for not being able to create even more. there's nothing scarier than unrealized potential and the sands of that hourglass aren't going to stop just because the outside world has. even when that potential is realized, then you gotta be afraid that it isn't good enough and that the only thing worse than never having realized that potential, is realizing your potential isn't as good as you'd hoped it was. time is a curse, only made moreso by the meaningless benchmarks we make– as if accomplishments are more valuable before you're 30 than after.",
            "self-plug: i wrote a segment on the amber ruffin show recently about this very feeling, and it makes me sad to know we're all going to think of this year in terms of our squandered creative potential. but i only bring it all up now because i can tell that bo struggled with this feeling, just as much as i am, just as much as everyone logging this and lamenting their own comparative lack of creative output seems to be, and i can only imagine how cathartic it was for him to have made and released this thing in spite of it all. i'm sure he'll deny it all the same, but this is undeniable proof of talent. equal parts mental/cultural commentary and satellite transmissions from an astronaut adrift. a wonderful piece of art that also serves as a meta-commentary on the fulfilling/obsessive nature of creative work, and how it feels to let your work both function as your great motivator and your great destroyer.",

Is it kind of a mess? Yes. Do the jokes always land? God no. Was I getting sick of Brad Pitt’s character? A little! Did I learn too much Thomas the Tank Engine lore? Maybe! But god dammit if I didn’t have a fun time at the theater with my friends and laugh my ass off a few times. Didn’t need or want much else out of this."

One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor... and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”",

I honestly can’t remember if Araki had this many shots of characters looking directly into the camera in his other work but that choice is working stronger than ever here. What I really appreciate about this is how he’s capturing the manipulation in all forms of abuse. His use of shoegaze also does so much as far as romanticizing not these specific events but adolescence. I just felt very close to Neil by the end, as though I was one of those little moons orbiting around him. I'll never forget about this movie."

I truly don’t understand, I could never understand, how Luca, Ivory, and the cast pulled this off. The feeling of love is so hard to replicate because everyone experiences it differently, but there’s something so universal about the looks Elio’s parents give eachother, or the way Elio repeats what he just said, just to make sure he believes it’s true.",

I want to understand what giving yourself to a person means, and what the fleeting moments of love really add up to. Is it all worth it? Are the short, beautiful memories of looking at the person you’re in love with worth the hours of agonizing pain when you’re not around them? Is the obsesssion normal? Is it all worth it in the end?",

            "love is fleeting. it can be experienced in the smallest of moments; the length of a song, one night together, a videotape. we're all just passengers floating through each other's lives. some of us make a bigger impact than others, but in that moment the emotion is raw and real and unfiltered. we're messy, chaotic creatures; we're explosively poetic. nothing captures that quite like fallen angels.",
            "i think after a third viewing i've finally been able to wrap my thoughts around this film and the beautiful, violent, romance of it all. i'm just so grateful that this film exists; that it gives me the knowledge that as my life goes on i'll get to experience more love and bring new people into my life and myself into theirs. no matter how fleeting that feeling may be."

Shaka King takes a crucial moment in history that could feel so cloying and unfocused in the hands of a less careful director, and gives us a smart, uncompromising tragedy about fear and power that properly portrays Bill O’Neal’s story as both a slave rebellion and an act of war.

            "This is my Black Panther. This movie empowered me. It helped me get over my rejection from the female known as Wendolene who’d rather date a Chad instead of a true gentleman who would treat her well. Amazing cinematography and a great performance by Shaun, who has fortunately moved on from artsy-fartsy hipster trash like Wallace and Gromit: A Close Shave. Films like Shaun the Sheep Movie are true art that often get misunderstood by filthy normies who watch WGCU kiddie movies instead of challenging, thought provoking kino like Southland Tales."

            "I can't believe the only thing any of you seem to want to talk about is the Juilliard scene when this has possibly the funniest ending i've ever seen to a movie that otherwise presents itself as having loftier, more pretentious ambitions. Was totally blindsided by it because I was sold a very different movie. Can't wait to watch all that early ambiguity and mystery about public image vs. private abuse/transgression, about power, ego, art, industry, etc again knowing that this is meant to be funny and that that is what Field ultimately has in mind for her spectacled “obliteration” in the face of an all-seeing God. Just brutal lol. I also love that it sets it up only to deny us (and her) the transcendent One Last Show you would expect and have seen worse filmmakers indulge in, and that might have accidentally through the emotional catharsis of the work itself implied her genius is somehow worth the cost. Instead choosing to stick with its slow and upsetting disruption and unraveling of routine/space right up to the very end, and hitting far more interesting notes of pathetic dissatisfaction. Good movie. \"How cruel of you to define our relationship as transactional.\""

And why did we hear a loud bang when he caught it if he caught the glass? Wouldn't there just be a glass cracking sound? Why was there a shockwave in the snow on the ground if the bus never actually reached the ground?",

            "Some will see the light during the first act HALO jump, when Tom Cruise caps off an exhilarating long-take by leaping out of a C-17 at 25,000 feet, aerial photographer Craig O’Brien capturing the stunt from the massive IMAX camera strapped to his chest (your move, Christopher Nolan). Others might cotton to the film’s brilliance during the bareknuckle fight scene that follows in the bathroom of a Parisian nightclub. Henry Cavill packs so much firepower into each punch that he literally has to reload his arms, and director Christopher McQuarrie — invoking the best of James Bond as he shoots the brawl without any music on the soundtrack — makes sure that we absorb every bodyblow and wince at each piece of busted tile.",
            "And if anyone is still on the fence after that, there’s a pretty good chance they’ll be convinced by what comes next: A symphonic, character-driven rescue operation/motorcycle chase/underground getaway sequence that speeds across the City of Lights along a breathless riptide of raw spectacle. Not since “Fury Road” have such viscerally practical effects been put to better use by such deliriously impractical people. And they’re only just getting started.

Decisions we made that we can't really call 'self-destructive', that's not quite it, but destroys our lives anyways. Destroys what we've built the last few years of our lives, and with no idea of how we'll survive after. Why do we do this to ourselves?",

You probably knew it going in, that it wouldn't work out, that it would always end up this way, but it's just what life pushed you towards. Is life supposed to be this flat, this stale? Is that really so bad? You're starting to think it is. You're starting to want to be the worst person in the world. At least then you'll know something is wrong.",

I think this movie is a masterpiece. Excellent vibes too - eerie and cool, like a roadside attraction in a thunderstorm."

            "Like any movie by Wes Anderson, “Asteroid City” is the epitome of a Wes Anderson movie. A film about a television program about a play within a play “about infinity and I don’t know what else” (as one character describes it), this delightfully profound desert charmer — by far the director’s best effort since “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” and in some respects the most poignant thing he’s ever made — boasts all of his usual hallmarks and then some. A multi-tiered framing device, diorama-esque shot design, and Tilda Swinton affectlessly saying things like “I never had children, but sometimes I wonder if I wish I should have” are just some of the many signature flourishes that you might recognize from Anderson’s previous work and/or the endless parade of A.I.-generated TikToks that imitate his style.",
            "As expected, the world of “Asteroid City” is meticulously arranged with clockwork precision, and — as expected — that world is then populated with memorable characters who try to assert the same degree of control over their own lives. Characters like Augie Steenbeck (Jason Schwartzman), a quietly grieving war photographer waiting for the perfect moment to tell his four young kids that their mom just died, as if there were a correct way to drop that kind of bomb on someone. “The time is never right,” he laments to the father-in-law who never liked him (a wonderfully sour Tom Hanks as Stanley Zak, a pistol always jammed down the front of his shorts). “The time is always wrong,” Stanley replies.",
            "The good news for Augie is that his teenage son Woodrow (“Eighth Grade” standout Jake Ryan) is probably smart enough to figure it out on his own; after all, the science prodigy is one of four Space Cadets who’s been invited to the 1955 Junior Stargazer Convention in the tiny Southwestern outpost of Asteroid City, where they’ll get to show off their latest inventions to a government delegation that includes five-star general Grif Gribson (Jeffrey Wright) and famed astronomer Dr. Hickenlooper (Swinton).",
            "Perhaps the most notable of the many other figures in town for the weekend is famous movie star Midge Campbell (a Scarlett Johansson, in full control of her own star power), who looks like Liz Taylor, takes after Marilyn Monroe, and materializes in the window opposite Augie’s motel room with the cosmic alignment of a solar eclipse. She’s always rehearsing for something, and never misses her cue. Her daughter Dinah, also being fêted in Asteroid City, will inspire a similar awe from Woodrow; par for the course in a film where love and loss orbit around each other in an endless chase, bound together by the gravity shared between them.",
            "So far, so typical, even if Asteroid City itself is as vibrant and elaborate a location as Anderson has ever conceived. Home to exactly 87 people, this one-pump town is split along either side of a long desert highway and criss-crossed by a set of train tracks the government uses to transport everything from pecans to nuclear warheads. There’s a luncheonette with 12 stools, a motor-court with 10 cabins, and a vending machine where you can buy tiny plots of real estate as if they were candy bars. There’s an unfinished off-ramp that strands cars about 15 feet in the air, and — in the distance — a massive crater formed by a meteorite that’s been waiting at the bottom of it for who knows how many years.",
            "Soaking up the “clean light” of the desert sun, Robert Yeoman’s camera reveals most of these sights to us in the span of a single 360-degree swivel, a flex that underlines Anderson’s absolute command over the film’s Chinchón set where his characters will soon be trapped against their will, thus forcing them to surrender the delusion of control that has defined so many of Anderson’s characters over the course of his career. It’s maybe the most radical thing that has ever happened in one of his movies — the sort of transformative moment that A.I. could never dream up no matter how much data it ingested — and it spins “Asteroid City” in a cosmic new direction. What until then was just another immaculate Wes Anderson film suddenly becomes one of a kind.",

            "Ever since I joined Letterboxd, nothing has scared me more than the idea of trying to write about 2001: A Space Odyssey. The fact that everything has \"already been said\" about this masterpiece has itself already been said so many times that there's not even an original means of expressing my lack of originality left at my disposal. So with the knowledge that I will probably never be able to fully encapsulate what makes this my favorite movie of all time—let alone say something truly unique about it—here is a small list of a few things I love about it.",
            "I love that the monolith has remained an enigmatic symbol capable of being read in any number of different ways regardless of its original intended purpose (if any).",
            "I love that the film prioritizes symbolism and thematic development over traditional storytelling.",
            "I love the way the story is broken up into four distinct acts, giving it a solid structure to communicate its complex ideas.",
            "I love the \"tone poem\" quality of the soundtrack, from the ominous choral nightmares of Requiem and Lux Aeterna to the final celebratory fanfare of Also Sprach Zarathustra.",
            "I love that Kubrick hired mimes to perform as the monkeys, giving them incredibly unique and memorable physical performances.",
            "I love the match cut from the technology of the bone hammer to the technology of the space ship across more than four million years.",
            "I love the model work, which gives us the most beautifully detailed space ships we've seen in any movie ever, practical or digital.",
            "I love how elegant and balletic the space station docking is with the synchronized rotation of the ship and The Blue Danube playing in the background.",
            "I love how beautiful all the photography is, but the Moon landing in particular stands out for me with its beautiful red lighting.",
            "I love that Dr. Floyd flies to Clavius Base on a nearly empty flight, communicating the idea that space travel has become a commonplace through simple staging.",
            "I love that in the future sandwiches come with the crusts cut off.",
            "I love that the astronauts get together for a picture in front of the monolith, as if it's just another vacation spot to take your kids.",
            "I love HAL and his creepy close ups.",
            "I love Dave and his sketches of the sleeping crew.",
            "I love Frank and his doomed game of chess with HAL.",
            "I love how disorienting all the camera angles are of the Discovery One while Dave and Frank watch the BBC interview.",
            "I love the reflected lights in Dave's space helmet.",
            "I love the fast-cut shots of HAL when he takes control of Frank's pod.",
            "I love the way HAL refuses to open the pod bay doors.",
            "I love the \"Beyond the Infinite\" sequence with its gorgeous slit-scan photography and the haunting inserts of Dave's mental breakdown.",
            "I love the Louis XVI bedroom and the way Dave sees himself aging and the way the camera passes off perspectives between the different Daves by having them see each other and then mysteriously disappear.",
            "I love the triumphant star child finale.",
            "I love 2001: A Space Odyssey. It is my perfect movie."

Coming-of-agers (at any age) are so often selfish to the point of excruciating obsession but Cooper looks out for little brothers and old friends and party guests and new loves and his mum, oh how he loves his mum. He’s a party starter! A people pleaser! An impossibly kind and big-hearted filmmaker and human who listens to others and tells them exactly how he feels (how dare he!) while also stubbornly continuing to make movies like this, so sincere, so unprovocative, when everybody else rolls their eyes and tells you it’s all too much. Maybe it is, but sometimes I think that’s vital. I loved it!"

            "You could hear a pin drop in a packed house. As soon as it was over, I sat in quiet, absolutely distraught. It made me feel genuinely sick. Nothing could have prepared me for this. We begin in darkness and end in total emotional torment. In a decade full with important films, I believe this is one of the most significant, if not the most. The reluctance to follow a conventional story is admirable; each sequence develops and builds until it bursts at the end and broke me. So relentless and strong, yet full of creative flair and distinct direction. The best sound design in quite some time, dedicated to providing a permanent, horrific experience. Glazer succeeds on all fronts by being not just a visionary director, but also one who can handle this with the utmost care and sincerity, unlike prior films of this nature. Not only do I think this is one of the best films of the decade so far, but one of the best for the century."

Practically radical in its insistence on a simple, quiet, warm existence where everyone in the American working class is striving, creating, and loving despite everything else trying to confine them. Your first and last piece of art is the life you live—monumental, highly doubt there will be a better movie this year."

            "i love that there’s absolutely no cynicism or irony in this movie, even in the little bits of humor he peppers in there. no winking, no audience surrogates, no comic relief. honestly, not even that many action scenes! where another blockbuster would throw in a fight, james cameron knows that he’s got far more interesting things to show us, an expansive world to build and attach yourself to. and doing so makes it even more explosive when one big sustained climax comes. only thing i didn’t love too much was the damn HFR– it worked for some scenes but overall it felt distracting, and kept making me think “wait why is this particular scene in 48.” also probably would’ve done without 3D but that’s because it really muddled how gorgeous the visuals are! i kept taking off my glasses and going “now that’s a nice shot.”"

            "I always love films about people feeling...lost. It reminds me of who I am. There's this feeling of trying to find a connection to something but there's a struggle as you don't know how to work that connection. That's what I think Wong Kar-Wai pulls off so well with this film. He creates these parallel stories of people who want to connect but are too lost to do anything about it. This is the true work of a master and I can already tell Wong Kar-Wai will be a great director to explore in the future. I kind of adore this movie if you haven't already realized."

            "As personal and egoless as you could ever hope to expect from an $120 million self-portrait that doubles as a fable about the fall of Ancient Rome, Francis Ford Coppola’s “Megalopolis” is the story of an ingenious eccentric who dares to stake his fortune on a more optimistic vision for the future — not because he thinks he can single-handedly bring that vision to bear, but rather because history has taught him that questioning a civilization’s present condition is the only reliable hope for preventing its ruin. Needless to say, the movie isn’t arriving a minute too soon.",
            "After more than 40 years of idly fantasizing about the project (and more than 20 years of actively trying to finance it), Coppola is bringing “Megalopolis” to screens at a moment when his chosen medium is struggling to find a way forward, and the world around it seems teetering on the brink of collapse. Just as in 63 B.C., when an evil patrician named Catiline appealed to a coalition of malcontents in a bid to overthrow the Republic, we are choked by the grip of delusional aristocrats and vertically integrated conglomerates whose lust for power and profit is only matched by their lack of foresight. Even with the past as our guide, we are at imminent risk of allowing the now to destroy the forever.",
            "Coppola has always believed in America, but his faith is eroding by the second, and “Megalopolis” is nothing if not the boldest and most open-hearted of his many bids to stop time before it’s too late (an effort that has informed so much of his career, from “Peggy Sue Got Married” and “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” to “Youth After Youth” and “Jack”). As ever, he recognizes the futility in the attempt, even if his characters are sometimes a bit slow on the uptake.",
            "What elevates “Megalopolis” so far above those other films — even “Jack” — is how clearly the constant madness of its folly and the occasional disaster of its design serve as conduits for its writer/director/producer/financier’s entire creative ethos. Coppola might lack the imagination required to invent the new cinema that his new movie so desperately wishes it could will into being (he’s not even De Palma in that respect, let alone Godard), but he’s always seen the need for it better and more urgently than any of his contemporaries.",
            "With “Megalopolis,” he crams 85 years worth of artistic reverence and romantic love into a clunky, garish, and transcendently sincere manifesto about the role of an artist at the end of an empire. It doesn’t just speak to Coppola’s philosophy, it embodies it to its bones. To quote one of the sharper non-sequiturs from a script that’s swimming in them: “When we leap into the unknown, we prove that we are free.”",

            "What makes a life a life? The people who raised you? The places you went? The home you grew up in? The historical events that occurred? The relationships you had? The deaths you witnessed? The philosophies you learned? This film is saying these are all correct, focusing on the idea that life is based off memory. Which then poses the question, is life only based off memory? Is what you didn't remember not considered a part of your life? Told with a visual style that had me literally pausing the film to take it all in, Mirror introduced me to a life so distant from my own but through a lens that felt so familiar. It's silly to think I or anyone is going to figure out the purpose and meaning behind life, but if there's anyone that'll make you feel like you're a little bit closer to figuring it out, it's Andrei Tarkovsky."

I walked out of the cinema in a daze, baffled and thrilled and grinning like a damn fool. My car is a two door red Honda Civic and yet I approached a white SUV with my keys out as if it was my ticket home because my mind was racing, overwhelmed by spectacle, dazzled by ambition.",

All I can think about is Interstellar, the audacious achievement by Christopher Nolan, the finest work of his career.",
            "When the film concluded, half the theater erupted into applause and the other half sat there scratching their heads wondering if they even liked it at all. I was stuck in some sort of cinematic purgatory, knowing I loved it and wanting to stand and cheer and yet my ass stayed glued to the seat and I remained quiet and still. It wasn't because the film isn't worthy, it is. It is worthy of more admiration than the clapping of hands can demonstrate. I can't explain why, but in that moment I was incapable of being a functional human being.",
            "I just wanted to sit there and watch it again, dissect the science, try to understand the confounding final act. Luckily on November 15th I plan on going back again and try to put more coherent words together to explain why I know I will cherish a film like this for years to come.",

Interstellar delivered everything I could have hoped for and more.",

The film, however silly the script is at times, feels bigger than you by the end. Joaquin Phoenix’s performance and Hildur Guðnadóttir’s score truly carry this film. Todd Phillips adds barely any originality in regards to the tone. People are gonna hate it for the wrong reasons, people are gonna love it for the wrong reasons.

            "Bad people are complicated. There is something dark at the centre of The Lost Daughter, a film which viciously tears apart the idealism we often have about motherhood. It is a film of mothers, but not one of love. Instead we see a rot, mothers who find children a burden. The Lost Daughter is an uncomfortable movie, with a constant unease and sense of dread. We wait to be given answers, for characters to be uncovered and exposed, and yet they aren't. This is a film which asks us to look inside ourselves and see if we can understand why the characters do what they do. Different people will feel differently about the film. Some will relate to it more than others. What The Lost Daughter carefully builds up is a sense of lingering pain, of memories that aren't sad but perhaps shouldn't have happened. It captures something rare, the way you can regret an amazing part of life. To be selfish and choose happiness can leave the soul despondent. The Lost Daughter does not centre on people who have made good choices, but it does examine the broken pieces that remain inside a person once bad decisions have played their course. With an amazing score and stunning performances, The Lost Daughter is executed superbly. It leaves a lot unspoken and exists in a dark, repressed place. Few films are so nuanced in examining human selfishness, and what makes it so disturbing is that the story itself is fleeting yet the regret we see is permanent.",

I could talk about the precision of his framing and tracking shots, and how often he finds visual comedy through a perfect edit, or the slight entrance of new material into the frame. I could talk about how depressing the film is, the hints of both a traumatizing past, and that in a way, Sam and Suzy try and burn a memory so deep into their minds that they can create a traumatized memory they want to remember (perhaps best seen by Suzy's scream during her ear piercing - \"do the other one\"). I could talk about how the film's metaphysical elements - the cuts between art and life (a camera dolly back from the binoculars to a stain glass vision of Noah's Ark), Balaban's narrator as weather man, camera man (turn that light on!) and God - creates an element that gives each character a sense that their existence has meaning, even as they feel utterly hopeless to have a purpose in life. I could talk about how snappy the dialogue is, the way how tenuous Sam and Suzy's first day of traveling is, until he finally acknowledges that she is just as pained as he is (Manic Pixie Dream Girl this is not). I could talk about the film's vision of cinematic history, from the French New Wave to Premminger to even Murnau in the steeple climax, adding to the film's magical sense that the past is present and it matters. I could talk about how after all this, when Sam whispers \"see you tomorrow,\" there is a chance that these two will never see each other, that they'll grow old, move on, and feel a bit silly about this adventure they had. And then one day they'll wake up, perhaps also in a disillusioned marriage hoping a storm carries one off, \"sucked up into space.\" But then maybe they'll see a painting of an island, a magical land called Moonrise Kingdom. It was only a fairy tale, but it'll make them smile.",
            "I could talk about all this, but I'd rather just watch this film again. This film is perfect."

She's standing in the middle of the concert hall lobby with bruises on her face and tears in her eyes and yet no one cares. They just put on a fake smile, talk about themself, and wait for her to perform for them like a monkey. Her whole life has been devoted to trying to prove herself and impress others, but no one really cares. It's so sad. Erika is one of the deepest, most fleshed-out characters of any movie ever made and Isabelle Huppert absolutely delivered one of the best performances ever."

            "there’s a scene in here that’s just a wide where the kid goes, “daddy are we gonna have to leave belfast?” the dad pauses, and then they immediately cut out of that scene. scenes and moments like this are littered throughout this film, all captured in a wide angle lens that makes the memories of branagh’s memoir feel cartoonishly distant from us. in this scene, he’s showing us an idea — that this kid is childishly unaware of the world that surrounds him and the dad doesn’t know how to communicate the reality to him —nothing more. we don’t watch the dad struggle to find the right words, we don’t see the kid discovering his father’s vulnerabilities, the scene feels like it still exists on the page. if this wanted me to feel the way it wants me to feel, it’d sacrifice one of its nine van morrison songs and take that time to sit with the uncomfortable conversations that would make it the honest retelling it desperately wants to be. one of the film’s (supposedly) most heart-wrenching  moments is shot from outside a window and from a birds eye view. again, comically distant and nothing more than eye candy. i get that its a crowd pleaser (for some reason) but would it kill branagh to give it any sort of evolution? walked away from this frustratingly unmoved"

            "My entire audience was dead silent through the credits of Society of the Snow, no one daring to so much as exhale and disturb the shock and stillness that had come over us during this film. I think this is the best man vs. nature/survival biopic I’ve ever seen, and certainly now the definitive telling of this story. Narratively it’s not anything entirely new, I wouldn’t imagine it playing out as well on a rewatch (or on Netflix sadly, see it in theaters if you can!), but J. A. Bayona brings such a grandiose and immersive feeling to this that put knots in my stomach the entire runtime. Will never forget the crash and avalanche sequences. The religious underpinnings are also tailor-made for me - this doesn’t focus as much on microscopic relationships, and I’m glad they didn’t manufacture some lord of the flies conflict because the real survivors said they never fought. Instead it asks bigger questions about how we assign meaning to life and tragedy, and where we find the divine in each other. M. Night Shyamalan needs to see this! Also, Michael Giacchino completing side quests?! The score is fantastic. I will probably rate this higher than most but I really enjoy this genre that is heavily populated by stinkers and am glad to report that this is the cream of the crop!"

It's always a very weird sensation when something does this because it's never what I expect, and I was not expecting it to happen several times while watching this! Very unifying to see so many of my own immigrant child experiences reflected in the immigrant child experiences of someone from an entirely different country whose family moved to an entirely different part of the US. Brought on a lot of tears. Can't think too much about the aspect of faith on display here or the grandma/grandson story without bringing them on again.",

It's a modern masterpiece of emotion, bringing the viewer on a ride of images and sounds that enhance the incredible characters brought to the screen. It's criminally under-seen, which is a sad thing to think about. La Haine deserves every ounce of praise and adoration.",
            "The Awesome: The characters, the writing, the cinematography, the direction, the acting, the opening, the way it tackles the issues of modern society, the conclusion, the DJ sequence, the rooftop scene. I could go on all day about this wonderful masterwork of cinema. La Haine is ultimately about violence, and how these three main characters weave in and around violence in their daily life. A powerful subject is only a great as its execution, and La Haine tells its story with grace and simplicity.",
            "The Terrible: Really? There's something wrong with La Haine? Nahhh....",
            "Overall, La Haine is a film that will sear into your mind, your heart, and your soul. It's essential viewing, and if you are a fan of Scorsese or Tarantino, shame on you for not seeing it already."

            "this is about a decade too late but still managed to entertain me nonetheless, and maybe even more now that i have a year of pandemic and much needed distance from the mcu under my belt. i was never bored (which is rare for me with marvel), and while it doesn’t feel wholly unique i didn’t really mind this time around. cate shortland was an interesting choice that i’ve been scratching my head over for years, but the central plot here does tie into her usual focus of free will, childhood trauma and the inner forces of good vs evil. and florence is definitely the standout, her villanelle-esque dry humor and thick accent threatening to leave scarlett in the dust with how easily she commanded the big screen. our beloved may queen is moving up in the world",

Kingdom is a patient movie, maybe at times too patient, to the degree where the first half feels a bit aimless— a consequence of jumping “many generations”. Possibly it’s biggest pitfall is that the truly juicy tension is established in the final minutes of the movie leaving me feeling even more frustrated with the first half.",

Tell me about yourself.\" If this was just a movie about serial murder via hypnotism it wouldn't be one of my all time favorites, but Kurosawa does something far creepier and harder to get a handle on: an epidemiological portrait of the howling void at the center of an entire society and the cauldron of violence simmering beneath the veneer of a compliant politeness.

It is a heist film dressed in science fiction conventions; and it is a study of a man trying to free himself from a near-suffocating past. \"Inception,\" at its more complex, is a cerebral pop-masterpiece. It is an enthralling combination of thought-provoking, layered story-telling and sumptuous aesthetics enhanced by near-flawless editing, sound design, effects, and musical score. Driven by a pitch-perfect cast and the confident directorial hand of Christopher Nolan, \"Inception\" is a brilliant and unrivaled piece of filmmaking."
